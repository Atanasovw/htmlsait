        Formula One originated from the European Motor Racing Championships of the 1920s and 1930s. The formula consists of a set of rules that all participants'<br />
        cars must follow. Formula One was a new formula agreed upon during 1946 with the first non-championship races taking place during that year. The first <br />
        Formula One Grand Prix was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix. A number of Grand Prix racing organisations had laid out rules for a motor racing world championship <br />
        before World War II, but due to the suspension of racing during the conflict, the World Drivers' Championship did not become formalised until 1947. <br />
        <br />
        This era featured teams managed by road-car manufacturers, such as: Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Maserati. The first seasons <br />
        featured pre-war cars like Alfa's 158. They were front-engined, with narrow tyres and 1.5-litre supercharged or 4.5-litre naturally <br />
        aspirated engines. The 1952 and 1953 seasons were run to Formula Two regulations, for smaller, less powerful cars, due to concerns over the lack of Formula One cars available.

        <br />
        The first major technological development in the sport was Bugatti's introduction of mid-engined cars. Jack Brabham, the world champion in 1959, 1960, and 1966, <br />
        soon proved the mid-engine's superiority over all other engines. By 1961 all teams had switched to mid-engined cars. <br />
        Motorsport and the aerospace industry came together ahead of the 1981 F1 season with the creation of the McLaren MP4/1 – famed for being the first <br />
        grand prix machine to have its monocoque constructed entirely from carbonfibre.
        Active suspension had drifted in and out of F1 prior to its 1990s heyday. Notably, <br />
        Lotus' Colin Chapman experimented with an anti-dive and anti-squat configuration <br />
        that ran longitudinally to prevent a car from pitching and diving under acceleration and braking.
        <br />
        <br />
        And these are only the few things that the sport has developed and every year they continue to develop and advance the technologies they use.<br />
        Many of our everyday use cars have some part of Formula One engineering in them.
